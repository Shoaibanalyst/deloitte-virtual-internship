# Deloitte Forage

This repository contains my submission for the Deloitte STEM Virtual Program. In this program, students are asked to help Daikibo Industrials (a global leader in manufacturing of heavy machinery) with variety of problems that they are facing.

## Task 01 - Coding

Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need help to combine the two files.

By completing this task, I learned how to manipulate json files in Python as well as how to use unittest framework to write and run test for a python code.

## Task 02 - Data Analysis

Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

- Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
- Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file. The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

1. In which location did machines break the most?
2. What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

By completing this task, I learned how to use the famous Software Analytics tool Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that help the Daikibo's tech team to answer their questions.
